# LUX Fishing Tool

## Description

This tool makes it easier to keep track of the fish you catch. Since instead of writing them one by one in the spreadsheet, you can just copy the whole chat (fishing history) and it will do the formatting for you


## Installation 

Download the folder named after your operating system from this <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jB0DPZG3YD96eNX0ljwyOTVxWFvShqCZ?usp=sharing">Drive</a>. The files are in packed in a .rar, so if you haven't already download <a href = "https://www.win-rar.com/">WinRAR</a> to unpack them.
Once downloaded and unpacked doubleclick "Updater.exe" and everything will be done. 

### Problems? 
#### If there is an error when opening the Updater.exe such that it doesn't automatically download the LUX.exe file:

Windows Defender is automatically deleting it. heres what you need to do:
- Go into Windows Defender > virus & threat protection > virus and threat protection settings > and toggle everything off for the time being
- On the same screen, scroll down until you see "exclusions" and click "add or remove exclusions"
- choose the folder that LUX.exe and Updater.exe are located. This will make Windows Defender skip over that folder while automatically scanning for updates
- toggle all the virus and threat protection settings back on. 

(this <a href = "https://www.easeus.com/computer-instruction/stop-windows-10-from-deleting-files-without-asking.html">link</a> also tells you how to stop windows from automatically deleting files, and how to add exclusions)


## How to use
- Copy the whole chat (fishing history) into the left text box (with the label above).   
- Copy the whole URL (for example: https://twitter.com/home or just twitter.com/home) where you fished and paste it in the middle text box. 
- After pressing the button, the data will be uploaded to a Firebase database.
- After everything is done, you will see the output of your session statistics and the overall statistics for the URL.
- There is also a button that shows the current best URLs of each planet type in the database. Aswell as a checkbox saying "Show stats of all planets combined" which when checked and pressing the second button will display the stats of all planets combined.
